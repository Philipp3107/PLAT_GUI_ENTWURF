## Fields:

### `private Label l;`

This field holds the label that is displayed on the BackButton. Being `private`, it can only be accessed within the `BackButton` class.

### `BranchView view;`

This is an object of type `BranchView`. It specifies the view related to the `BackButton`.

## Constructor:

### `public BackButton(BranchView view)`

This constructor initializes a new `BackButton` object. The `view` parameter needs to be an instance of `BranchView`. It defines the view that the `BackButton` class is associated with.

Please replace the omitted constructor details with the actual implementation.
